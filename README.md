### Predicting churn from user attributes

Data: Telecom customer data  
Techniques: Calculating churn probability and expected loss, random forest  

Here I look at a telecom customer data set. Each row contains customer attributes such as call minutes during different times of the day, charges incurred for services, duration of account, and whether or not the customer left or not.

### Documents  
churn_helper.py contains functions to calculate churn probability, expected loss, 
calibration, and discrimination  
model_helper.py contains functions for model and cross validation  
Churn.ipynb goes through the workflow
